### Jittered


This sketch is a reimagined version of my original "Jitterbug" sketch. In this sketch, the ideas have been reduced to shapes, rather than images. Instead of text and a Pacman board, we have a solid background and ellipses. Instead of ghosts, we have a jitter class that increases in randomness as the mouse moves across the screen and when the mouse is pressed.
